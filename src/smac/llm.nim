## Claude-backed unit command. A policy is just a prompt: the game server
## composes the seat's view plus that seat's PLAYER_PROMPT and asks Claude what
## its unit does for the next 5.0 seconds.
##
## Ported from `cogame-bullwhip/src/bullwhip/llm.nim`, behaviour for
## behaviour — the credential ladder, the Bedrock model rotation, the
## fence-tolerant JSON extraction and the rune-boundary truncation are all
## that file's, because they are all scar tissue from real hosted failures.
##
## This is a SIMULTANEOUS-decision game, so ALL FIVE seats' calls go out as
## ONE parallel batch per turn (`curly.makeRequests`). Seats are never queried
## sequentially: that is what keeps 36 turns inside the wall-clock budget.
##
## Credentials, in order of preference:
##   Bedrock sidecar (AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME + AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK)
##   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
##   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_URI
## With none of them the client disables itself and every turn falls back to
## the scripted layer INSTANTLY, with no network wait — which is what lets
## offline certification finish in seconds.

const SystemPrompt* = """
You command ONE unit in a five-unit squad fighting a scripted enemy army in a
top-down arena 1235 by 659 pixels. Your whole squad shares ONE score: how much
of the enemy army you destroy, whether you wipe it out, and how much of your
own health survives. Personal kills are worth almost nothing.
RANGER: you shoot. Range 380 pixels, 4 damage, one shot every 0.75 seconds, 60
health, 66 pixels per second. You die to two seconds of melee contact.
BLADE: you swing. Reach 56 pixels in a 90-degree wedge, 10 damage, one swing
every 1.25 seconds, 120 health, 76 pixels per second - faster than a ranger.
The enemy has the same weapons. Enemy units pick the closest of you they can
see and walk at it until it dies.
FOCUS FIRE IS THE WHOLE GAME. Five units shooting five different enemies kill
nothing; five units on ONE enemy kill it in about three seconds, and a dead
enemy stops shooting back forever. Every enemy carries a numeric id: name it in
"target_id" and say it out loud so the others pick the same one.
KITING: a ranger out-ranges a blade six to one but is slower. Backing away
while your weapon is on cooldown wins free damage - until you run out of arena.
SCREENING: a blade standing between the enemy and a ranger buys that ranger the
seconds it needs. A dead ranger deals no damage for the rest of the battle.
Every 5 seconds you issue ONE order for yourself. A deterministic controller
executes it for the next 5 seconds: it walks you where you asked around walls,
turns you to face what you asked, and pulls the trigger when the shot will
land. You never control motors or the trigger directly.
You can see the whole board: every unit, its health, what each enemy is walking
at, and how many of you are already shooting it. You cannot see what your
squadmates are deciding THIS turn - all five of you decide at the same moment -
so use "say" to call your target.
Reply with a single JSON object and NOTHING else. Your reply MUST begin with '{'.
Schema:
{"note":"<=160 chars","cogs":[{"id":"<your own id>",
  "intent":"focus|attack_move|kite|hold|screen|retreat|regroup",
  "target_id":<enemy id> or null,
  "target":[x,y],
  "face":[x,y] or null,
  "say":"<=10 chars"}]}
Intents: focus = attack the enemy named by target_id (a ranger holds 300 pixels
off it, a blade closes to touching range); attack_move = advance to `target`
and attack whatever comes into range on the way; kite = attack the nearest
enemy while backing off to 340 pixels, standing still only to fire (rangers
only; a blade reads it as focus); hold = stand at `target` and fire at anything
in range; screen = put yourself 90 pixels in front of the most wounded friendly
ranger, between it and the nearest enemy; retreat = walk to `target` and do not
fire; regroup = move to the middle of your surviving squadmates.
`face` biases your aim. `say` is SHOUTED and every nearby squadmate hears it.
